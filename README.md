# Project Code - Getting Started

To run the application, you must start both the backend and frontend components. Please follow the instructions I've included below to get everything up and running smoothly.

## Starting the Backend

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the appropriate Flask directory.
2. Run the following command to start the backend:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

This will initialize the backend of the application.

## Starting the Frontend

1. In your terminal, navigate to the appropriate React directory.
2. Start the frontend by running the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

This will initiate the frontend part of the application.

With both the backend and front end running, you should be able to access and interact with your application seamlessly.

##Important Note

Please be aware that the API key used in this application is a dummy. To make the application functional, you need to add your own API key.

Make sure to replace the expired API key with your valid key in the appropriate configuration file to ensure that the application works as expected.

By following these steps, you can set up and run both the backend and frontend of the application successfully.
